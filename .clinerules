# Cline Rules for OpenRouter Image MCP Server

## Project Context
This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for image recognition using OpenRouter API with vision models.

## Development Guidelines

### Running the Server
- The server runs via stdio and is configured in Cline's MCP settings
- Use `python -m openrouter_image_mcp.server` to test locally

### Configuration
- All configuration via `.env` file (copy from `.env.example`)
- Required: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` - get from https://openrouter.ai/keys
- Optional: `OPENROUTER_MODEL` - defaults to `openai/gpt-4o`

### Testing
- Add images to analyze via their file paths
- The server accepts both single and multiple images
- Prompt is passed from Cline based on user request

### Adding New Features
- Vision models support: jpg, png, gif, webp, bmp
- Consider adding more image formats if needed
- Can add support for image URLs in future versions
